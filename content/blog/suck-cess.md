## Radriders is a blog again!

So now we can all just forget about all this shit and go ride bikes.

No wait, don't. At least, not yet.

Thanks to the smart people down at [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), I've been able to spin up this blog. Now I have a place to froth my ideas and thinkings where it's not just taking up precious space in my head. Since I was really expecting to do this, I have no real thoughts to expel so let's just carry on our days like this never happened, deal?

One last thing: thanks to the author of the [hugo-bear theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) for at least giving me something to use to get me off the ground until I decide I need to be super-nitpicky and rewrite everything from scratch.

Carry on, then.
