One of the great lessons that we all learn in life is that no matter what you do, a certain number of people are just going to be idiots. There are two courses of action we can take in response to this:

1. Do our best to move past it and try to ignore it, or
2. Write a dickish post on your blog about the things that bug you.

Since I'm really bad at the first (try as I might), I guess here we are doing the second. So if I'm going to have to deal with idiots, I at least want them to be as obnoxious as possible so I have a good story to tell later.

If you're reading this there's a good chance that you're not currently an asshole, so let's not waste anymore time getting you on your way.

## Be oblivious to your surroundings

Nobody likes somebody who is courteous and conscientious of those around them. Not in my tax bracket, anyway. The best thing you can do to make sure that you can't hear someone behind you hoping to pass or someone letting you know they are coming around that blind corner is to **always wear headphones**. Just as important, make sure the music is loud enough that there is no possible way that any outside noise could possibly get through to you. If a passenger jet crashed in the forest a few hundred feet from you, you don't want to be frightened by the noise, right? Safer to just read about it once you get back to your home.

If someone does get fed up and passes you aggressively because you've been ignoring them the past few minutes, make sure they know that you are the victim here.

Unfortunately, a few super-lame entrepreneurs have developed bone conduction technology that allows you to listen to music and still be able to hear what's going on around you. Steer clear.

## Make sure everyone can hear your ~~shitty~~ music.

I was going to call people out on their shitty music. But then I remembered when it's blasting out of a Bluetooth speaker in the middle of the forest there's no such thing as shitty music.

## Do lots of skids and ride in mud

Contrary to popular belief and also reality, trail builders make a fucking ton of money. Like the guy who leads our local trail crew is making in the mid-six figures for just walking around and touching up berms and doing some weed whacking and also he has a group of like six people working for him and they are all pulling in at least a hundred grand.

So make sure to give them a lot of work to do so they can keep their plush, full-time jobs. Lock the brakes up as often as possible, especially if it has rained recently and you can chew some big grooves into the dirt. And if you're lucky enough to come across some puddles that haven't had a change to dry yet, make sure to go around them and make the trail as wide as possible.

One of the best things you can do to be a high-quality asshole is to cut your own trails. If you find it's easier to just cut through a section of trees because it helps your Strava time by a couple of seconds, you are entirely justified. On the same note, *modifying* a feature to make it a bit easier because you've been struggling with it is a completely acceptable thing to do. Improving your riding is stupid.

## Don't be nice to anyone / don't smile / poop on the trail

This should be unspoken but I find most tutorials on being an asshole glaze over some of the basics so I just want to make sure you've at least heard of these concepts. Due dilligence or whatever.

## Throw your garbage anywhere and everywhere

It used to be a forest until we conquered the shit out of nature and dug a few trails into the ground, now we can do as we please. Think about the contradiction we'd have otherwise - why are developers allowed to tear up forests and build beautiful cookie cutter subdivisions on them and I can't even artfully hang a Tim Horton's cup on a tree branch? It's the least you can do to keep things fair in the world. You can't call yourself an asshole mountain biker until you've left your Nature Valley wrapper at an intersection.

So there you go, I think you've at least got a good handle on what you need to do if you want to go out and make someone feel a little bit sadder about the state of humanity and the world in general.
