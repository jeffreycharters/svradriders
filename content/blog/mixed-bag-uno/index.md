My brain thinks in small chunks. People (actually search engines) want these big, long, well-thought-out and well-written articles and goodness me, I'm just not prepared to provide that. So instead this is the first of what will probably be a never-ending string of "Mixed Bag" sections because they are easier. The internet also needs more of me, there is way too much everyone-else out there and I find it overwhelming.

Alright, let's dig in.

### The 1x Conversion Update

Recently you will recall that I wrote a very long, well-written update on [converting my mountain bike]({{< relref "/blog/one-by-conversion.md" >}}) to a "one-by" drivetrain. I've had the opportunity to go for a fre test drives on local trails, including some of the techier bits that would normally offer my derailleur an apparently insurmountable challenge.

*and holy shit it works!!*

I know, I didn't really actually think it would work either, but after a few rides I've got a grand total of zero (0) dropped chains. I'll keep track if I ever start having chains fall off and keep you posted. I'm sure it will happen, but so far, I'm impressed.

The only drawback is that I've noticed that I'm maxxing out my speed on some pretty shallow gradients while riding on tarmac on the way to/from trails. But I don't really care too much because mountain biking is not really concerned about shallow gradients on tarmac. On the flip side, I've ridden some pretty punchy climbs using the new gear as well. I wouldn't mind having a bit more room on my cassette to make some steeper climbs, but I currently feel pretty out of shape so I'll just suck it up and maybe plan to replace my cassette with something that can go up to 42T eventually.

One other thing: My friend Mr. Anderson (yes the bad guy from *The Matrix*) reminded me having a clutched derailleur also helps with not dropping chains. Eventually I'll write an article called "Whattf is a clutch derailleur and how do I know if mine is that?" but until then just search for it on Duck Duck Go (never Googs).

Would you recommend to a friend? *sure.*

### Be careful out there

One of the reasons I think it took longer than anticipated to get out on the upgraded full-squisher is that I was almost ran over by some dingus in his SUV turning left into me on a bright sunny day when it was 100% my right-of-way.

It rattled me.

I've been riding to school or work or just professionally (as a messenger, not a talented professional) since I was like 11 years old. This is my thing, it's what I do. And I've been involved in more close calls than anyone would even bother counting because it happens **all the gosh-heck time**. And I'd say 95%+ of the time it's because the other person is a real chucklehead. The remaining 5%- of the time it's because the other person is a chucklehead and I'm a troll and like messing with them.

[**Aside:** Once when I was a messenger I was going to count the number of red lights I ran in a day. After about half an hour I was already at 17 so said screw it.]

Details don't need to be expounded upon and it doesn't really matter because it's all in the past and we move on. But I just want to remind anyone who is biking on the road to keep their head on a swivel, assume everyone is super-distracted all the time and remember that cyclists pretty much lose any collision they're involved in.

So use lights, ding the shit out of your bell even though they are lame and stupid.

Then just get out there and keep riding. As off-road as possible, all the time.

### Website Update

It's looking better around here, eh? I know there are still issues if you're trying to use dark mode, I'll get to it soon enough. It's hard to work on this during the summer. Luckily we've been getting a lot of rain so I find opportunities to change things a bit here and there.

There are still a few things formatted in a weird way, I plan to fix those soon as well. None of it should take much time, it's just getting to it.

But for now, things are usable so use them we shall.

That's it for now. I have all these ideas to write about but it's always in the form of "I love *Product X*, you should purchase *Product X*" but I feel like that's what 103% of the internet is based on and I hate it but I really do enjoy these products.

So maybe we'll make a deal: I get to talk about all this cool stuff and I won't link to it and if you are really taken with *Product X* you can go and purchase it and then you can also feel smug. Deal?
