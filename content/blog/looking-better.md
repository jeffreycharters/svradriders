Alright, we're starting to get things looking a bit more like home.

Things are looking *really* good for the future of RadRiders. Yesterday we sat down as a team and brainstormed a hundred possible ideas for blog posts. They aren't all good, and a lot of them were just a random blurting out of words, but a number of them are worth getting excited for.

In numeric order, here are a few of the gems that will probably be rejected:

16. Anxiety and how to have it.
22. Bear is being a dick and bugging me.
30. I lost 0 pounds biking to work everyday.
35. Bananas
74. Should I wear a tie more often?
83. My pronouns

These ideas seem pretty bad, but there are actually more usable ideas in the list than we might have expected.

*Bear being a dick and bugging me.*

Having said that, there are a number of topics from commuter biking to gravel and mountain biking to the pro racing scene to music and computer stuff.

So stick around, this might actually be cool this time around.
