### We're back, hosers!

ðŸš´ðŸ’¨ We're always back.

This time let's focus on content instead of just dicking around pretending we're going to add functionality that we all know we'll never add.

So here's to finally getting around to taking more photos, writing about the things that are good, bad and indifferent in the world and doing it all with a sense of poise and dignity.

I'm Dade Wilcox, founding member of the Radriders multinational conglomerate and I know you have your choice of shitty blogs and we *thank you for choosing Rad*.
