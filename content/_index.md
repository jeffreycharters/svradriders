We're back.

This time let's focus on content instead of just dicking around pretending we're going to add functionality that we all know we'll never add.

I'm Dade Wilcox, founding member of the Radriders multinational conglomerate and I know you have your choice of shitty blogs and we *thank you for choosing Rad*.
